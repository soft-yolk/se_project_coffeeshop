# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

# Sprint 2, Stage 2. Creating a website layout

This stage of the project is a webpage lander that showcases a hero image, text, nav-bar, iframes, and other various sections that provide additional information. Stage two of this project has covered HTML, CSS, BEM, positioning, and flexboxes.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I think it would be helpful to incorporate a static 'Back to Top' button that would appear once scrolled past the page fold.

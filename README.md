# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

# Sprint 2, Stage 4. Advanced HTML and CSS

This stage of the project completes the webpage lander that showcases a menu of flexboxes, a form, an animated about section, and a footer to wrap up the page.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I think it would be helpful to incorporate a static 'Back to Top' button that would appear once scrolled past the page fold.

It would be helpful to include ways to use drop down menus or even a sticky nav bar.
